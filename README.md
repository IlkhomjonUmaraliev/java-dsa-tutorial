## Fork and Pull Requests

1. Go to original github repo and fork it.
2. Clone the repo which is now copied to your github account
3. *use this command* git fetch upstream 'link of the original repo' *to sync your fork*
4. Make changes and push it to your remote repo
5. Create a pull request

## git log
*this command is used to see the entries

## git reset commit id
*this is used to reset the all the commits after the specific commit id

## git push --force 
Do this when your repo is only used by you (if other people are using your repo it can lead to fatal errors)
